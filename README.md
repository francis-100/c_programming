Add a header

# FOR LOOP

No semi-colon after parenthesis in the for loop - Instead use curly braces and in a new line
While working with char data type ensure the variables have single quotation marks around them e.g char lc = 'a';
Semi-colon should be used twice; during initialisation and in the test statement only. No semi-colon after incrementing or decrementing
To decrement just reverse the order of the loop statements
Add space just after typing for then type the parenthesis
Your curly braces should be in-line with letter f in for. Indent the output
Indent the inner loop in nested loops
Use percent sign to specify the format of your outputs. Helpful while outputting data stored in variables
Always use less than or greater than sign to test a statement. The equal sign is optional, use it based on your needs
